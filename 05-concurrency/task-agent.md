## Agents

Agents are an abstraction around background processes maintaining state.  We can access them from other processes within our application and node.  The state of our Agent is set to our function's return value:

```elixir
iex> {:ok, agent} = Agent.start_link(fn -> [1, 2, 3] end)
{:ok, #PID<0.65.0>}

iex> Agent.update(agent, fn (state) -> state ++ [4, 5] end)
:ok

iex> Agent.get(agent, &(&1))
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

When we name an Agent we can refer to it by that instead of its PID:

```elixir
iex> Agent.start_link(fn -> [1, 2, 3] end, name: Numbers)
{:ok, #PID<0.74.0>}

iex> Agent.get(Numbers, &(&1))
[1, 2, 3]
```

## Tasks

Tasks provide a way to execute a function in the background and retrieve its return value later.  They can be particularly useful when handling expensive operations without blocking the application execution.

```elixir
defmodule Example do
  def double(x) do
    :timer.sleep(2000)
    x * 2
  end
end

iex> task = Task.async(Example, :double, [2000])
%Task{pid: #PID<0.111.0>, ref: #Reference<0.0.8.200>}

# Do some work

iex> Task.await(task)
4000
```
